# HTML-based-Survey-Form

This is a survey form which I created using CSS and HTML. This form takes the name, email ID , age and the occupation of the respondent as inputs . It then takes the skills which the respondent has knowledge of and asks for any specifications like expected salary, shift time and location. It is designed to help job-seekers to search jobs for themselves.
